My project contains a jupyter notebook which pulls in and merges data from the Data folder. I used python to combine the csv's into clean_df.csv, I added the regions in Excel and saved the final csv as clean_df3. You can open the notebook by opening up the terminal and writing "jupyter notebook". You can also open git bash and write "jupyter notebook". Once in the notebook, you can run all of the cells and it will show the tables and graphs for each cell. The data folder contains csv's for years 2015 to 2019.
